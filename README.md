# Switch-Bot
Introduction
<br>
Automation of the old switches. But for most of the products, we have to deal with the house's internal wiring, but with our switch bot, we can control the switch externally only. 
<br>
Our switchbot is the easiest thing you can do to make your old switches into intelligent controllers.
<br>
It just sticks to any of the switchboards. We can connect our switchbot via WiFi or Bluetooth to our phone, Alexa, or any smart home device. 
<br>
You can turn off or turn on any rocker-based switch with just a tap on the phone or a touch of a button. With IoT, we can control the switch over the fiber.
<br>

Need for this Innovation
<br>
Convenience: Automating a switch can make your life more convenient by allowing you to control your lights or other devices without having to physically be in the room. 
<br>
Accessibility: Automating switches can also make your home more accessible for people with disabilities or mobility issues.
<br>
Customization: With automated switches, you can customize your home to your specific needs and preferences.
<br>
Installation: Unlike other smart devices which require alterations in the internal wiring our switchbot can be installed with a simple adhesive based tape. 

<br>
Working
<br>
In this device, the input can be given in two ways: touch sensor or our app.
<br>
The app provides the information to the NodeMCU through its wifi module (inbuilt),and the touch sensor is directly connected to the NodeMCU.
<br>
Then the received signal is processed by the microcontroller, i.e., whether the call is to turn off or on the switch.
<br>
Accordingly, it sends the call to the servo motor, which has an arm connected to it, which further helps to turn off or on the switch.
